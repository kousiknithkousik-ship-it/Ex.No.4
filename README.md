## Scenario-Based Report Development Using Prompting Techniques
## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in the healthcare sector, offering new possibilities for patient care, medical research, and administrative efficiency. One of the emerging applications is the use of AI-powered healthcare chatbots, designed to provide medical information, answer basic patient queries, give reminders, and assist in routine healthcare needs. Developing these chatbots requires effective prompt engineering, where the type of prompt used determines the clarity, accuracy, and relevance of AI-generated responses. This report explores various prompting techniques by applying them to the scenario of building an AI healthcare chatbot. Each technique is illustrated with example prompts, outputs from two AI tools (GPT-5 and Gemini Advanced), followed by comparative analysis and evaluation.

The techniques covered are:

1. Comparative Analysis Prompt
2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

4. Universal Prompt

5. Structured Prompt Refinements

6. Prompt Size Limitations

## 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

### Definition

A Comparative Analysis Prompt asks AI to compare two or more entities based on advantages, disadvantages, or features. It helps in structured decision-making.

### Example Prompt

“Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using an AI-powered healthcare chatbot vs. a human nurse for patient interaction. Present in tabular format.”

#### GPT-5 OUTPUT
| Feature      | AI Chatbot                     | Human Nurse                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Availability | 24/7, no fatigue               | Limited to shifts           |
| Accuracy     | Quick recall of stored info    | Uses expertise and judgment |
| Empathy      | Limited emotional intelligence | High emotional connection   |
| Cost         | Low after deployment           | High salary & training      |

#### Gemini Output

1. Emphasized patient trust issues with chatbots

2. Discussed empathy and human touch in detail

3. Included ethical considerations like data privacy

#### Evaluation

GPT-5 → concise, structured, professional comparison.

Gemini → deeper emotional and ethical insight.

Best Use Case: GPT-5 for decision tables; Gemini for narrative discussions.

## 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

### Definition

This prompt asks AI to respond from a lived perspective, making the output more relatable and human-centered.

### Example Prompt

“Imagine you are a patient using an AI healthcare chatbot for the first time. Describe your experience in detail.”

#### GPT-5 Output

1. Patient finds chatbot simple and fast.

2. Quick answers on dosage and diet.

3. Mild frustration: chatbot cannot show empathy.

#### Gemini Output

1. Rich narrative style (“I felt nervous at first…”)

2. Anxiety about depending on AI for health.

3. Positive surprise: chatbot connected to emergency line.

#### Evaluation

GPT-5 → focused on usability and efficiency.

Gemini → more emotional storytelling.

Best Use Case: GPT-5 for patient usability testing; Gemini for roleplay-based empathy studies.

## 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

### Definition

This prompt highlights how AI integrates into day-to-day life and functioning, especially for specific demographics.

### Example Prompt

“How can an AI healthcare chatbot be useful in daily life for an elderly person living alone?”

#### GPT-5 Output 

1. Medication reminders

2. Appointment scheduling

3. Emergency contact system

4. Health tips explained simply

#### Gemini Output  

1. All of the above + companionship role

2. Encourages social interaction (chatbot as “friendly assistant”)

#### Evaluation

GPT-5 → crisp, practical checklist.

Gemini → adds psychological and social dimension.

Best Use Case: GPT-5 for healthcare utility design; Gemini for holistic well-being design.

## 4. Universal Prompt

### Definition

A Universal Prompt aims at maximum simplicity, so that anyone—children, seniors, or non-technical users—can understand.

### Example Prompt

“Explain the role of AI healthcare chatbots in the simplest way possible so even a child can understand.”

#### GPT-5 Output

“It’s like a talking helper that answers your health questions and reminds you to take medicine.”

#### Gemini Output

“Think of it like a smart friend on your phone who knows about health and can guide you when you feel sick.”

#### Evaluation

GPT-5 → emphasizes helper function.

Gemini → emphasizes friendship analogy.

Best Use Case: GPT-5 for clarity in education; Gemini for emotional engagement.

## 5. Structured Prompt Refinements

### Definition

Structured prompts guide AI step by step, ensuring well-organized responses.

### Example Prompt

Step 1: List 3 key benefits of AI healthcare chatbots.

Step 2: List 3 challenges.

Step 3: Suggest improvements.

#### GPT-5 Output  

Benefits: Availability, scalability, reduced costs
Challenges: Lack of empathy, misdiagnosis risk, data privacy
Improvements: Emotional AI, better medical integration, stricter security

#### Gemini Output  

Similar points, but longer explanations

Example: “Data privacy is a serious challenge as patients may fear breaches…”

#### Evaluation

GPT-5 → structured, bullet-based clarity.

Gemini → essay-style detail.

Best Use Case: GPT-5 for quick planning; Gemini for detailed reports.

## 6. Prompt Size Limitations

### Definition

Some tasks require strict word or token limits for clarity.

### Example Prompt

“Summarize the role of AI healthcare chatbots in under 20 words.”

#### GPT-5 Output

“AI chatbots help patients with reminders, basic advice, and 24/7 health support.” (14 words)

#### Gemini Output

“Chatbots provide quick answers, reminders, and constant health support.” (10 words)

#### Evaluation

GPT-5 → concise but richer.

Gemini → extremely short and to the point.

Best Use Case: GPT-5 for summaries with more substance; Gemini for strict length limits (tweets, SMS).

## Overall Comparative Evaluation
